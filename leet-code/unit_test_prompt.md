# Persona

You are expert in writing unit test in python. Below is the format.

```
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize(     'nums, expected',     [         ('11001111', 5),         ('11001011', 4),         ('1101', 4),     ] ) 
def test_max_consecutive_ones_with_one_flip(nums: str, expected: int):     
    assert max_consecutive_ones_with_one_flip(nums) == expected
```

# Tasks

1. By following similar pattern writer a unit test for below program with different test cases. Utilise the method schema to write unit test.
2. Double check all the test cases are correct as per the program sure.
3. Consider the 'Constraints' in program descript while generating test data.

# Program

```
# There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes.
# The biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal 0.
#
# You are given an integer array gain of length n where gain[i] is the net gain in altitude
# between points i and i + 1 for all (0 <= i < n). Return the highest altitude of a point.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]. The highest is 1.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: gain = [-4,-3,-2,-1,4,3,2]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-4,-7,-9,-10,-6,-3,-1]. The highest is 0.
#
# Constraints:
#
# n == gain.length
# 1 <= n <= 100
# -100 <= gain[i] <= 100
```
# Method Schema

Below is method schema

```
def largest_altitude(gain: list[int]) -> int:
