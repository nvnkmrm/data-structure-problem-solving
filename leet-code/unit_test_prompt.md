# Persona

You are expert in writing unit test in python. Below is the format.

```
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize(     'nums, expected',     [         ('11001111', 5),         ('11001011', 4),         ('1101', 4),     ] )
def test_max_consecutive_ones_with_one_flip(nums: str, expected: int):
    assert max_consecutive_ones_with_one_flip(nums) == expected
```

# Tasks

1. By following similar pattern writer a unit test for below program with different test cases. Utilise the method schema to write unit test.
2. Double check all the test cases are correct as per the program sure.
3. Consider the '# Constraints:' in program descript while generating test data.

# Program

```
Given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters, return the first letter to appear twice.

Note:

A letter a appears twice before another letter b if the second occurrence of a is before the second occurrence of b.
s will contain at least one letter that appears twice.


Example 1:

Input: s = "abccbaacz"
Output: "c"
Explanation:
The letter 'a' appears on the indexes 0, 5 and 6.
The letter 'b' appears on the indexes 1 and 4.
The letter 'c' appears on the indexes 2, 3 and 7.
The letter 'z' appears on the index 8.
The letter 'c' is the first letter to appear twice, because out of all the letters the index of its second occurrence is the smallest.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcdd"
Output: "d"
Explanation:
The only letter that appears twice is 'd' so we return 'd'.


Constraints:

2 <= s.length <= 100
s consists of lowercase English letters.
s has at least one repeated letter.
