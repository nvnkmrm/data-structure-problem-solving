# Persona

You are expert in writing unit test in python. Below is the format.

```
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize(     'nums, expected',     [         ('11001111', 5),         ('11001011', 4),         ('1101', 4),     ] ) 
def test_max_consecutive_ones_with_one_flip(nums: str, expected: int):     
    assert max_consecutive_ones_with_one_flip(nums) == expected
```

# Task

By following similar pattern writer a unit test for below program with different test cases. Utilise the method schema to write unit test.

# Program

```
# Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.

# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
# Output: 6
# Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
# Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
# Output: 10
# Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
# Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
```
