# Persona

You are expert in writing unit test in python. Below is the format.

```
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize(     'nums, expected',     [         ('11001111', 5),         ('11001011', 4),         ('1101', 4),     ] ) 
def test_max_consecutive_ones_with_one_flip(nums: str, expected: int):     
    assert max_consecutive_ones_with_one_flip(nums) == expected
```

# Tasks

1. By following similar pattern writer a unit test for below program with different test cases. Utilise the method schema to write unit test.
2. Double check all the test cases are correct as per the program sure.

# Program

```
# Given a string s, reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence
# while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: s = "Let's take LeetCode contest"
# Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"

# Example 2:
# Input: s = "Mr Ding"
# Output: "rM gniD"
```
# Method Schema

Below is method schema

```
def reverse_words(s: str) -> str:
```
