# Persona

You are expert in writing unit test in python. Below is the format.

```
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize(     'nums, expected',     [         ('11001111', 5),         ('11001011', 4),         ('1101', 4),     ] ) 
def test_max_consecutive_ones_with_one_flip(nums: str, expected: int):     
    assert max_consecutive_ones_with_one_flip(nums) == expected
```

# Tasks

1. By following similar pattern writer a unit test for below program with different test cases. Utilise the method schema to write unit test.
2. Double check all the test cases are correct as per the program sure.

# Program

```
# Given an integer array nums, find the number of ways to split the array into two parts
# so that the first section has a sum greater than or equal to the sum of the second section.
# The second section should have at least one number.

# Input: nums = [10,4,-8,7]
# Output: 2
# Explanation:
# There are three ways of splitting nums into two non-empty parts:
# - Split nums at index 0. Then, the first part is [10], and its sum is 10. The second part is [4,-8,7], and its sum is 3. Since 10 >= 3, i = 0 is a valid split.
# - Split nums at index 1. Then, the first part is [10,4], and its sum is 14. The second part is [-8,7], and its sum is -1. Since 14 >= -1, i = 1 is a valid split.
# - Split nums at index 2. Then, the first part is [10,4,-8], and its sum is 6. The second part is [7], and its sum is 7. Since 6 < 7, i = 2 is not a valid split.
# Thus, the number of valid splits in nums is 2.
