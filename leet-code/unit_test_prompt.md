# Persona

You are expert in writing unit test in python. Below is the format.

```
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize(     'nums, expected',     [         ('11001111', 5),         ('11001011', 4),         ('1101', 4),     ] )
def test_max_consecutive_ones_with_one_flip(nums: str, expected: int):
    assert max_consecutive_ones_with_one_flip(nums) == expected
```

# Tasks

1. By following similar pattern writer a unit test for below program with different test cases. Utilise the method schema to write unit test.
2. Double check all the test cases are correct as per the program sure.
3. Consider the '# Constraints:' in program descript while generating test data.

# Program

```
# Given an integer array arr, count how many elements x there are, such that x + 1 is also in arr.
# If there are duplicates in arr, count them separately.

# Example 1:

# Input: arr = [1,2,3]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 1 and 2 are counted cause 2 and 3 are in arr.

# Example 2:

# Input: arr = [1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: No numbers are counted, cause there is no 2, 4, 6, or 8 in arr.

# Constraints:

# 1 <= arr.length <= 1000
# 0 <= arr[i] <= 1000
```

# Method Schema

Below is method schema

```
def countElements(arr: list[int]) -> int:
```
